Welcome to Battleship!

This version is: 0.2

Controls--

When opening the game:

left-click to add a ship.
left-click on a ship to turn it.
right-click on a ship to remove it.
return to advance to the next ship.

In menus:

return to select choice.
up and down arrows to change selection.

While typing address:

like a normal textbox, but keypad is disabled.
return to enter choice.

Once all ships have been placed, you will choose to either serve or join a game. If you choose to serve a game, your game will freeze while waiting for a connection.

If you choose to join a game, your game will freeze while connecting.

Once connected, your game will unfreeze.

Gameplay:

During your turn, your pas shots will be displayed. Green shots mean misses, and red ones mean hits. You cannot shoot on a previous shot. When you shoot, the result of your shot will be displayed for one second. During this state, there is no way to know what your oponent's board is, as the layout is never transfered. If you sink all the opoenent's ships, a "You Win!" screen will show. You should then procede to closing the game.

While waiting for your oponent's shot, your ships will be displayed, and all the past shots of your oponent will also be displayed. Once your oponent shoots, it will be displayed on your screen for one second. If he/she sinks a ship, you and your enemy will be notified by a message preceded by '*'. If he/she sinks all your ships, a "You Loose" screen will show. You can still talk to eachother, but then you should then procede to closing the game.

Text Box:

The text box is moveable, but not closeable. I might make it smaller in future versions. Type in the text box, and press return. Your message should be sent to your enemy, and will also appear on your screen. There is a history of ten messages in the scroleld list above. Once a new message arrives, the list of messages will automatically scroll to the bottom. You can still scroll freely in between messsages

Current known bugs:

You can place ships over other ones, but this plays to your disadvantage because they can both be hit at the same time : )
If your connection fails, the address is not unbound. If one person quits, an error is raised on the other side.

Todo:

Fix bugs. Add music. Better graphics.
